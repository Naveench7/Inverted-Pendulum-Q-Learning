# Optimal-Control

## Overview
The goal of this project is to learn a policy for an inverted pendulum model to make it do a swing-up motion. Beyond the task of inverting a pendulum, the goal is to also gain an understanding of how Q-learning works, its limitations, and its advantages.

## Installation
The code is tested with Python 3.8.0, Matplotlib 3.7.1, Numpy 1.24.2, and Ipython 7.34.0.

## How to Run
Download the .ipynb file and run.
